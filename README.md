# Password-Hasher-GUI
This project provides a password hashing tool using SHA-256, featuring a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter.
The application allows users to enter a password and view its hashed value in an easy-to-use window.

Features
- Hash Passwords: Calculate the SHA-256 hash of a password.
- Interactive GUI: User-friendly interface built with Tkinter for password input and hashing.

Requirements:
Python 3.x: The script is compatible with Python 3.
Tkinter: GUI library for Python (included with Python).
hashlib: Module for hashing (included with Python).

How to Use

Clone: 
git clone https://github.com/mrgagan17/Password-Hasher-GUI.git

Navigate to the Project Directory: 
cd Password-Hasher-GUI

Run the Tkinter GUI: 
python hash_password.py

Use the GUI: 

Enter a password in the "Enter Password" field.
Click "Hash Password" to compute the SHA-256 hash.
View the hashed password in the "Hashed Password (SHA-256)" field.
Click "Clear" to reset both input and output fields.

This Tkinter-based password hasher project demonstrates how to use Python's hashlib library to securely hash passwords using the SHA-256 algorithm, while providing a simple graphical user interface for ease of use. It serves as a practical tool for understanding how password hashing works and how hashes can be generated and displayed.
